# Home_Sales_Challenge

In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

overview
1.What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

4.What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query?

5.Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime. Partition by the "date_built" field on the formatted parquet home sales data.
